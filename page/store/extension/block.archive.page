use:
  '.\lot\x\block': 1
  '.\lot\x\page': 1
...

Use this extension to show all of the visible pages in a single page content as a link list.

### Basic Usage

Put this block in the desired page content you want to display the link list to:

<pre><code class="txt">&#x5B;<span>&#x5B;archive&#x5D;</span>&#x5D;</code></pre>

### Advance Usage

#### Sorting

By default, this extension will display the list of pages sorted ascending by its title. If you add `time` attribute with value `true` or a time pattern, then each list item will be completed with page publication time, and list order will be made based on the page publication time:

<pre><code class="txt">&#x5B;<span>&#x5B;archive time="true"&#x5D;</span>&#x5D;

&#x5B;<span>&#x5B;archive time="%Y/%m/%d&#x5D;</span>&#x5D;</code></pre>

#### Folder Selection

You can also limit the list output by determining the folder path relative to `.\lot\page`. This is useful for creating archive page by category:

<pre><code class="yaml">---
title: Archive
description: Site archives by category.

### Articles

&#x5B;<span>&#x5B;archive path="/article"&#x5D;</span>&#x5D;

### Extensions

&#x5B;<span>&#x5B;archive path="/store/extension"&#x5D;</span>&#x5D;</code></pre>

#### Nesting Level

The maximum recursion value is `4` by default, but you can specify another number. Determining value `0` will deactivate the recursive list feature:

<pre><code class="txt">&#x5B;<span>&#x5B;archive deep="0"&#x5D;</span>&#x5D;</code></pre>
