Create a `kick.tsv` file in `.\lot\page` folder:

~~~ .txt
.\
└── lot\
    └── page\
        └── kick.tsv
~~~

Write some URL path and its new URL path on each line in the file. Separate old URL path data and its new URL path data with a tab character:

~~~ .tsv
/foo/bar.html         /foo/bar
/2019/24/lorem-ipsum  /2020/05/lorem-ipsum
/about-company        /about/company
/about-us             /about/us
~~~

Please note that the example above uses space characters to visualize the tab characters. Original file must use the real tab characters to separate between fields.

You can also use `kick.csv` file, but some people find this format is not so easy to read:

~~~ .csv
/foo/bar.html,/foo/bar
/2019/24/lorem-ipsum,/2020/05/lorem-ipsum
/about-company,/about/company
/about-us,/about/us
~~~
