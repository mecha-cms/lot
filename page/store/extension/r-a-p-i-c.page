Insert advertisements code in random position between the existing paragraphs in the page content.

### Usage

Open `.\lot\x\r-a-p-i-c\engine\r\layout\ads.php` then put your advertisements code there.

To disable the automatic advertisements placement on certain page, add a `r-a-p-i-c` property within your pageâ€™s `state` property with a value that can be evaluated to `false`:
