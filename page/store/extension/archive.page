This extension activates the time filter feature by utilizing the `time` property of the page to add several routes such as `http://127.0.0.1/blog/archive/:date` on every page to allow users to list all pages in the current folder by time.

As a note, every time you want to link a page to a specific year-based archive, be sure to add the pagination offset to the end of the URL to prevent Mecha from mistakenly interpret the archive year as pagination offset:

~~~ .txt
http://127.0.0.1/blog/archive/2020 ✘
http://127.0.0.1/blog/archive/2020/1 ✔
~~~

Other than that are safe enough, even though I would prefer you to add it anyway, for consistency:

~~~ .txt
http://127.0.0.1/blog/archive/2020-09/1
http://127.0.0.1/blog/archive/2020-09-18/1
~~~
