This extension provides various API to work with BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG and WEBP images.

### API Usage

#### Create Image

Create a new image from a file path, an external URL or a Base64 URL:

~~~ .php
// Create image from file
$blob = new Image('.\path\to\image.png');

// Create image from remote URL
$blob = new Image('http://127.0.0.1/path/to/image.png');

// Create image from Base64 URL
$blob = new Image('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAADIAAAAy…');
~~~

#### Get Image Dimension

Get current image width and height:

~~~ .php
$width = $blob->width;
$height = $blob->height;
~~~

#### Get Image Type

Get current image MIME type:

~~~ .php
$type = $blob->type;
~~~

#### Resize Image

Resize image to an absolute width and height:

~~~ .php
$width = 100;
$height = 50;
$blob->resize($width); // Is the same as `->resize($width, $width)`
$blob->resize($width, $height);
~~~

#### Scale Image

Resize image width and height relative to the current image width and height:

~~~ .php
$blob->scale(50); // 50% of current image dimension
$blob->scale(200); // 200% of current image dimension
~~~

#### Fit Image

Resize image and make sure that the width and height will not overflow the maximum width and height:

~~~ .php
$max_width = 100;
$max_height = 100;

$blob->fit($max_width, $max_height);
~~~

#### Crop and Resize Image

Resize and crop image to the center:

~~~ .php
$width = 100;
$height = 100;

$blob->crop($width); // Is the same as `->crop($width, $width)`
$blob->crop($width, $height);
~~~

#### Crop Image without Resize

Crop image with custom X and Y coordinate:

~~~ .php
$left = 20;
$top = 20;
$width = 100;
$height = 100;

$blob->crop($left, $top, $width, $height);
~~~

#### Save Image

Store the modified image blob to a file:

~~~ .php
$blob->store('.\path\to\image-1.png');
$blob->store('.\path\to\image-1.png', 50); // Set image quality to 50%
~~~

#### Draw Image

Show image to the browser window as a file:

~~~ .php
$blob->draw();
~~~

~~~ .php
$blob->draw(null, 50); // Set image quality to 50%
~~~

Draw and store to a file:

~~~ .php
$blob->draw('.\path\to\image-1.png', 50);
~~~

Draw as JPEG image:

~~~ .php
$blob->draw(null, 50, 'image/jpeg');
~~~

### Image API with Page Extension

This extension will also add `image` and `images` property to the current `$page` object. The `image` property will contain the first image URL found in the current page content, and `images` property will contain list of images URL found in the current page content. This extension will skip the parsing process if you set the `image` and `images` property values explicitly in the page file header:

~~~ .html.php
<?php foreach ($pages as $page): ?>
<article>
  <?php if ($image = $page->image(72, 72)): ?>
  <img alt="" src="<?= $image; ?>">
  <?php endif; ?>
</article>
<?php endforeach; ?>
~~~
