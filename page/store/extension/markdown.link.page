This extension will generate automatic link text and title attribute based on the page path provided. If the page file you are trying to provide does not exist, this extension will mark the automatic link with a red strikethrough text effect.

### Usage

The link syntax is exactly the same as referenced link syntax in Markdown, the only difference is that you need to add a `link:` prefix to the reference ID:

~~~ .markdown
[‌link:page-one] → will be replaced with `[Page Title](http://127.0.0.1/path/to/page-one "Page Title")`
[‌link text‌][‌link:page-one] → will be replaced with `[link text](http://127.0.0.1/path/to/page-one "Page Title")`
[‌link:does-not-exist‌] → will be replaced with `<s style="color:#f00;" title="[‌link:does-not-exist‌]">broken link</s>`
~~~

All of the page path provided will be parsed relative to in which the page is stored. To go to the upper level of the current page path, you can use `../` pattern:

~~~ .markdown
[‌link:../blog/page-one‌] → will be replaced with `[Page Title](/path/blog/page-one "Page Title")`
~~~
