  '.\lot\x\asset': 1
  '.\lot\x\block': 0
  '.\lot\x\page': 1
...

This extension lets you build automatic table of contents on the page that has several headers in it so that you can use it to navigate between page headers. If you set the `type` value to `2`, then the table of contents will not be inserted into the page content, and this extension will only serve as an automatic permanent link ID generator for every header in your page content.

### Basic Usage

Configuration data are available in `.\lot\x\t-o-c\state.php`.

#### Custom Header ID

You have the full control to determine your own header ID using the **Markdown Extra** syntax or with plain HTML markup. This extension will not overwrite the specific ID that you have specified in the header:

~~~ .markdown
#### Header Special {#special}
~~~

~~~ .html
<h3 id="special">Header Special</h3>
~~~

### Advance Usage

#### Exclude Headers from TOC

Add `not:t-o-c` class to the desired headers to exclude them from the TOC tree and to disable the automatic permanent link ID creation:

~~~ .markdown
#### Example Header {.not:t-o-c}
~~~

~~~ .html
<h3 class="not:t-o-c">Example Header</h3>
~~~

#### Custom Placement

If you have the _Block_ extension installed, you can put `[‌[‌t-o-c‌]‌]` block anywhere in the page content to mark the position you want to put the generated TOC tree to.

~~~ .yaml

#### Disable TOC

There are several ways to disable the automatic table of contents placement.

The first way is through the extension configuration, that is, by setting the value of the `type` property to `0` or `false` (alias for `0`). This will disable the table of contents by default:

~~~ .php
<?php

return [
    'type' => 0,
    'id' => [ … ],
    'class' => [ … ]
];
~~~

To re-enable the table of contents, set the value of `t-o-c` property within your page’s `state` property as `1`, `2` or `true` (alias for `1`):

~~~ .yaml
---
title: Page Title
description: Page description.
author: Taufik Nurrohman
type: Markdown
state:
  t-o-c: true
...
~~~

The second way is through the page properties. To disable the automatic table of contents placement on certain page, add a `t-o-c` property within your page’s `state` property with a value that can be evaluated to `false`:

~~~ .yaml
---
title: Page Title
description: Page description.
author: Taufik Nurrohman
type: Markdown
state:
  t-o-c: false
...
~~~

#### Override TOC Configuration Data

You can rewrite the TOC configuration data on the `t-o-c` property to override the initial configuration data:

~~~ .yaml
---
title: Page Title
description: Page description.
author: Taufik Nurrohman
type: Markdown
state:
  t-o-c:
    type: 2
    class:
    - table-of-content
...
~~~
