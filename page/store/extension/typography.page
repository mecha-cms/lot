This extension converts some plain ASCII punctuation characters into “smart” punctuation HTML entities:

 - Convert straight quotes (`'` and `"`) into ‘curly’ quote HTML entities.
 - Convert dashes (`--` and `---`) into ‘en-dash’ and ‘em-dash’ HTML entities.
 - Convert three consecutive dots (`...`) into an ‘ellipsis’ HTML entities.
 - Convert `x` between numbers into a ‘times’ HTML entities.

This extension will not modify characters within `<pre>`, `<code>`, `<kbd>`, `<script>`, `<style>` and `<textarea>` elements because these elements are commonly used to display text where smart quotes and other “smart punctuation” would not be appropriate, such as in source code or example markup.
