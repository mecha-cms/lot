**Mecha** is a file–based CMS that is focused on the principle that a static website must be personal, portable, light and easy to be exported and backed up. However, this doesn’t mean that Mecha is powerless. Mecha has a fairly flexible set of API that you can use without having to make it bloated, keeping you happy focused on developing your own website, according to your personality.
