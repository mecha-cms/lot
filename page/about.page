title: About
description: Mecha is a file-based content management system that carries the concept of minimalism. This content management system is suitable for use by journalists or bloggers who prioritize simplicity and speed in the presentation and transfer of their site data. Not everyone has free time to sit at the table and think about what to write.

Mecha survives on the principle that a database-less site should be personal, portable, light and easy to be exported and backed up. That’s why most of the [projects][link:store] associated with Mecha are created with personal natures and are dedicated to be used for personal purposes such as blog, journal and [diary](https://taufik-nurrohman.com). Mecha’s market shares are people with high creativity and individuals who want to dedicate themselves to the freedom of speech that probably don’t have much time to learn web programming languages. By introducing Mecha as files and folders that used to be seen by people everyday in their working desktop, we hope you will soon be familiar with the way Mecha CMS works.

Mecha is as simple as files and folders. Yet, that doesn’t mean that Mecha is weak. Mecha has fairly flexible set of [API][link:reference] that you can use without having to make it bloated, keeping you happy focused on developing your own site, according to your personality.

If you want to make something that is super huge with Mecha, that would be possible, but remember that Mecha wasn’t created to replace databases. Mecha was previously created simply to help people getting rid of various resources that are not needed from the start (such as databases). There will be a time when you need a database, and when that time comes, just use a database. Mecha is fairly open to be extended with other database-based applications.

 4. Take a look on the available [extensions][link:store/extension] and [layouts][link:store/layout] that you might be interested.
 5. Upload your extension files to `.\lot\x` and your layout files to `.\lot\layout`. They’re auto-loaded.
