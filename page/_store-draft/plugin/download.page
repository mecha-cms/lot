Provides a download link with security token to prevent hotlinking. This plugin will also count the number of downloads.

### Usage

Store your files in the folder related to your download page:

~~~ .txt
lot\
└── page\
    ├── my-page\
    │   ├── file-1.zip
    │   ├── file-2.zip
    │   └── folder-1\
    │       ├── file-1-1.zip
    │       └── file-1-2.zip
    └── my-page.page
~~~

Then show the download link this way in `my-page.page`:

~~~ .txt
[‌[‌download path="file-1.zip"‌]‌]
~~~

~~~ .txt
[‌[‌download path="folder-1/file-1-1.zip"‌]‌]
~~~

Currently, there is no such native way to upload the files directly from the page editor, but you can always change the page manager view into a generic file manager by adding a page offset to the current page editor URL and then append `?view=file` query string to the URL:

~~~ .txt
http://127.0.0.1/panel/::g::/page/my-page → http://127.0.0.1/panel/::g::/page/my-page/1?view=file
~~~

From there you should be able to access the basic file uploader.
