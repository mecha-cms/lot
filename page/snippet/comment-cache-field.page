title: Store User Comment Data in the Comment Form
description: Using session to store your visitorâ€™s comment data in the comment form.
...

Requires [comment][link:../reference/extension/comment] extension.

~~~ .php
if (!HTTP::is('post')) {
    $previous = (array) Session::get('comment');
    unset($previous['content']); // Remove `content` cache
    $cache = alter($previous, (array) Session::get('form'));
    Session::set('form', $cache);
}
~~~

Next time your visitor want to add a new comment, they will always see that the name, email and URL fields in the comment form are already filled in with their previous data.
