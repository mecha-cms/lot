title: Store User Comment Data in the Comment Form
description: Using session to store your visitorâ€™s comment data in the comment form.
...

Requires [comment][link:../reference/extension/comment] extension.

~~~ .php
if (!Request::is('post')) {
    $cache = [
        'author' => Request::restore('post', 'author', Session::get('comment.author')),
        'email' => Request::restore('post', 'email', Session::get('comment.email')),
        'link' => Request::restore('post', 'link', Session::get('comment.link'))
    ];
    Request::save('post', $cache);
}
~~~

So, the next time your visitor want to add a new comment, they will always see that the name, email and URL fields in the comment form are already filled in with their previous data.
