title: Mark Site Author’s Comments
description: Set a unique style to the site author’s comments.
...

Requires [comment][link:../reference/extension/comment] extension and [user][link:../reference/extension/user] extension, and requires you to be logged in when creating a new comment.

Add this CSS code to style the site author’s comments based on the default `comments.php` template:

~~~ .css
li.comment.comment-status\:1 {
  background:#def;
  padding:1em;
}
li.comment.comment-status\:1 .comment-figure {margin-left:1em}
~~~

Which is based on this markup:

~~~ .html
<li class="comment comment-status:<?php echo $comment->status; ?>">
  …
  …
</li>
~~~
