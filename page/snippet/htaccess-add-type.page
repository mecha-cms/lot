title: PHP in CSS and JavaScript Files
description: Using HTACCESS to parse PHP syntax in CSS and JavaScript files.
...

This snippet can be used for any other PHP CMS with `.htaccess` support. Open any `.htaccess` file that you see in the `asset` folder, then add this command to the next line:

~~~ .htaccess
AddType application/x-httpd-php .css .js
~~~

You can now embed PHP syntax on any CSS and JavaScript files stored in the `asset` folder that stores this custom `.htaccess` file.
