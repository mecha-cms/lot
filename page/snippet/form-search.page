~~~ .html
<form action="<?php echo $site->is('pages') ? $url->clean : Path::D($url->clean); ?>" method="get">
  <?php echo Form::text($config->q, HTTP::get($config->q)) . ' ' . Form::submit(null, null, 'Search'); ?>
</form>

The search functionality is a native feature of the [page][link:../reference/extension/page] extension. By appending a `?q=foo+bar` query string to the end of a URL, it will automatically search for pages that contains `foo` and `bar` in the file name. This feature does not have ability to search for text within the page file content due to the performance problem on every file-based CMS. This search functionality will also search only for files that are placed within the current directory. So, there is no such thing called recursive search.
