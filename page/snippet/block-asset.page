title: Asset Block
description: Maintainable asset URL in page content.
...

Using [blocks][link:../reference/extension/block] in place of the base URL will make the asset URL in page content becomes maintainable. So, if another day you want to migrate the asset files to a different domain, you can just replace the block value instead of editing the whole pages to update the old asset URL.

~~~ .php
// Set a block parser with ID `asset`
Block::set('asset', function($content) {
    // Replace `[‌[‌asset‌]‌]` with public asset URL
    return Block::replace('asset', To::url(ASSET), $content);
});
~~~

Usage:

~~~ .yaml
