title: How to Update to the Latest Version of Mecha
description: How to update your site safely.
...

There are some folders in the `lot` and `engine` folder, whose the contents will not change:

**lot:**

 - `asset`
 - `comment` [^1]
 - `extend`
 - `page`
 - `shield` [^3]
 - `state`
 - `tag` [^2]

**engine:**

 - `log`

You can change all of the existing files except the contents inside the folders above. Up to whether you want to update the rest of the folders by reâ€“uploading them or by editing each files inside them one by one, or by downloading the static folders I have mentioned above, and then delete the entire site, replace it with the fresh version of Mecha, then put back the downloaded folders to the previous location.

[^1]: [connect:../reference/extension/comment]
[^2]: [connect:../reference/extension/tag]
[^3]: Except the `document` shield folder.
