There are some folders in the `.\lot` folder, whose the contents will not change:

 - `.\lot\asset`
 - `.\lot\comment` [^1]
 - `.\lot\layout`
 - `.\lot\page`
 - `.\lot\tag` [^2]
 - `.\lot\user` [^3]
 - `.\lot\x`

You can change all of the existing files except the contents inside the folders above. Up to whether you want to update the rest of the folders by re-uploading them or by editing each files inside them one by one, or by downloading the static folders I have mentioned above, and then delete the entire site, replace it with the fresh version of Mecha, then put back the downloaded folders to the previous location.

[^3]: [connect:../store/extension/user]
