title: CKEditor’s Image Upload Path
description: Configure custom image upload path for neat file structure.
...

Did you know that our [CKEditor][link:../reference/extension/c-k-editor] extension has ability to set custom image upload path? By default, the uploaded images will be stored in the `ASSET` folder, in a folder named as the image file extension. This is the default location path where the image will be stored if we upload an image named as `Picture (Copy 1).jpg`:

~~~ .txt
.\lot\asset\jpg\picture-copy-1.jpg
~~~

The default image upload path setting can be found in the configuration file. Open `.\lot\extend\c-k-editor\lot\state\config.php` to customize:

~~~ .php
<?php

return [
    …
    …
    'filebrowserImageUploadPath' => 'lot/asset/%‌{‌extension‌}‌%/%‌{‌name‌}‌%.%‌{‌extension‌}‌%'
];
~~~

Some [candy syntax][link:../reference/extension/plugin/candy] are available to customize the `filebrowserImageUploadPath` property:

Syntax | Value
------ | -----
`%‌{‌date‌}‌%` | A [`Date`][link:../reference/class/date] instance with its properties.
`%‌{‌extension‌}‌%` | The current file extension.
`%‌{‌hash‌}‌%` | Random string generated by [`Guardian::hash()`][link:../reference/class/guardian/hash].
`%‌{‌id‌}‌%` | Unique ID generated by PHP `uniqid()`.
`%‌{‌name‌}‌%` | The current file name without file extension.

So, for example, if you set the `filebrowserImageUploadPath` to `lot/asset/foo/bar/%‌{‌name‌}‌%.%‌{‌extension‌}‌%`, then the image you have uploaded will be stored as:

~~~ .txt
.\lot\asset\foo\bar\picture-copy-1.jpg
~~~

And if you set the `filebrowserImageUploadPath` to `lot/asset/foo/bar/%‌{‌id‌}‌%.%‌{‌extension‌}‌%`, then the image you have uploaded will be stored as:

~~~ .txt
.\lot\asset\foo\bar\5a6d4215e1e65.jpg
~~~

And this is how to set the configuration value so that the uploaded images will be automatically stored by the file upload date:

~~~ .php
<?php

return [
    …
    …
    'filebrowserImageUploadPath' => 'lot/asset/%‌{‌date.year‌}‌%-%‌{‌date.month‌}‌%-%‌{‌date.day‌}‌%/%‌{‌name‌}‌%.%‌{‌extension‌}‌%'
];
~~~

Result will be like:

~~~ .txt
.\lot\asset\2018-01-28\picture-copy-1.jpg
~~~
