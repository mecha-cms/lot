description: Replace the default home page with a custom one.
...

The easiest way to replace the default home page appearance is to use the built-in feature. By default, home page appearance will use `.\lot\page\index.page` file as the page content. It is because the default configuration set the home page path as `/index`. If you want to change the home page path, go to `.\state.php` then replace the `path` value with the desired page path. It can be anything as long as it is exists:

~~~ .php
[
    'path' => '/article', // ← this
    'zone' => 'Asia/Jakarta',
    'charset' => 'utf-8',
    …
]
~~~

You should be automatically redirected to the home page when you go to `http://127.0.0.1/article`.
