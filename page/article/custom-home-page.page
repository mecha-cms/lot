description: Replace the default home page with a custom one.

The easiest way to replace the default home page appearance is to use the built–in feature. By default, home page appearance will use `lot\page\index.page` file as the page content. It is because the default configuration set the home page path as `index`. If you want to change the home page path, go to `lot\extend\page\lot\state\config.php` then replace the `slug` value with the desired page path. It can be anything as long as it is exists:

~~~ .txt
return [
    'type' => "",
    'slug' => 'index', // ← this
    'chunk' => 3,
    'sort' => [-1, 'time']
];
~~~

You should be automatically redirected to the home page when you go to the ` [[url]]/index ` URL.
