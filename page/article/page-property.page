To call a property from a page, do this:

~~~ .php
$page->foo_bar;
~~~

The default value is always `null`. This is the thing that makes Mecha version `2.x.x` different from version `1.x.x`. In version `1.x.x`, calling a property that does not exist from a page will trigger an error message, but not in version `2.x.x`. In version `2.x.x`, any page property is valid and has the value of `null` unless you set a value explicitly to it, either from [page headers][link:../reference/extension/page#reference:page], [page data][link:../reference/extension/page#reference:data], or from a return value that is generated by [hooks][link:../reference/class/hook].

To set a value to the `foo_bar` property, add a data in the page header with `foo_bar` as the property key:

~~~ .yaml

foo_bar: Test property value of `foo_bar`.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

To set a value to the `foo_bar` property from a separated file, add a file named as `foo_bar.data` to the related folder:

~~~ .txt
lot\
 └── page\
     ├── test-page\
     │   └── foo_bar.data
     └── test-page.page
~~~

To set a value to the `foo_bar` property with a hook, do this:

~~~ .php
Hook::set('page.foo_bar', function($value) {
    // `$value` is `null` by default
    return 'Test property value of `foo_bar`.';
});
~~~

Now, `$page->foo_bar` will return “Test property value of \`foo_bar\`.”
