To call a property from a page, do this:

~~~ .php
$page->fooBar;
~~~

The default value is always `null`. This is the thing that makes Mecha version `2.x.x` different from version `1.x.x`. In version `1.x.x`, calling a property that does not exist from a page will trigger an error message, but not in version `2.x.x`. In version `2.x.x`, any page property is valid and has the value of `null` unless you set a value explicitly to it, either from page header, page data, or from a return value generated by [hooks][link:../reference/class/hook].

To set a value to the `fooBar` property, add a data in the page header with `foo-bar` as the property key:

~~~ .yaml

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

To set a value to the `fooBar` property from a separated file, add a file named as `foo-bar.data` to the related folder:

~~~ .txt
.\
└── lot\
    └── page\
        ├── test-page\
        │   └── foo-bar.data
        └── test-page.page
~~~

To set a value to the `fooBar` property with a hook, do this:

~~~ .php
Hook::set('page.foo-bar', function($value) {
    // `$value` is `null` by default
    return 'Test property value of `fooBar`.';
});
~~~

Now, `$page->fooBar` will return _“Test property value of \`fooBar\`.”_.
