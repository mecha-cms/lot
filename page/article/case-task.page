title: Task File
description: Disposable commands.
...

Mecha introduces `task.php` file functionality in the core version greater than `2.0.0`, which is just an includable file that functions exactly the same as the `index.php` file, but is intended to be used once. This file will be stored along with the `index.php` file and may or may not exist depending on the requirements. All `task.php` files will be loaded automatically as the `index.php` file. But, the special thing about this file is that it is always equipped with a command to destroy itself when a condition has been met.

~~~ .php
if (!is_dir($folder = LOT . DS . 'page')) {
    // Create folder if not exists
    mkdir($folder, 0777, true);
} else {
    // Self destruct
    unlink(__FILE__);
}
~~~

This file can be placed in any extensions, layout and even in the core folder.

~~~ .txt
.\
├── engine\
├── lot\
│   ├── cache\
│   ├── layout\
│   │   ├── …
│   │   ├── index.php
│   │   └── task.php ✔
│   ├── page\
│   └── x\
│       ├── …

│           └── task.php ✔
├── .htaccess
├── favicon.ico
├── index.php
├── state.php
├── task.php ✔
└── LICENSE

In the future, I may add a `task.php` file to the root directory in other versions to perform automatic repair tasks before this file will eventually destroy itself. So that I don’t need to provide a step-by-step guide to users about how to fix here and there after some errors occured during core update.
