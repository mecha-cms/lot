title: The `Genome::_()` and `Genome::__instance__()` Methods
description: Counting the class instances.
...

I have just added this method to the [`Genome`][link:../reference/class/genome] class. Applying the `_` static method will trigger the `new` operator to the current class, and will store the class instance to the `Genome::$_instance[ … ][]` array. This internal ability is currently no use, but may be in the future:

~~~ .php
class Foo extends Genome {}

$foo_1 = new Foo();
$foo_2 = new Foo();

// Problem: How to count the number of `Foo`’s instance?
~~~

~~~ .php
class Foo extends Genome {}

$foo_1 = new Foo();
$foo_2 = new Foo();

__test__(Foo::__instance__()); // → 2
~~~
