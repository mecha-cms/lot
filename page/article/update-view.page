title: Updating Mecha Manually
description: This is just a visualization for my previous article [here][link:update].
...

Currently, _Mecha_ version `2.x.x` is still in active development, so it is normal when you want to see what’s new by updating your _Mecha_ site multiple times. There will be a time when you get to see that everything is broken by your own hand. Common practices like copying and pasting new files to overwrite the old files aren’t safe because _pasting_ will only override the currently available files, but doesn’t know what files need to be deleted. In this tutorial, I will explain step by step how to update your _Mecha_ site safely with better visualizations.

### Step 1: Create a Site Copy

Before doing anything, make sure that you have created a local copy of your site, either as its normal files and folders or as a package. Save it somewhere outside the working directory!

### Step 2: Create a Temporary Folder

Create a temporary folder in the root folder of your _Mecha_ site then name it as you like. Let’s say it `test`:

### Step 3: Install a Fresh Mecha Package

Download the package from [here][link:../home] then put it in the `test` folder. Extract it!

### Step 4: Moving the Static Files

Now go to the `lot` folder of the parent folder then select all folders that contain static files, including the `state` folder. Copy or cut them all then paste in `.\www\test\lot`:

> **Note:** You may delete the `page` folder first, which contains some default pages as the site example.

### Step 5: Make Sure That the Site is Running

Now visit `http://127.0.0.1/test` to make sure that the site is visible as expected even without any custom extensions and plugins at all:

> **Note:** If you get a _red_ message like `View::load("page/index")` in the page then it was caused by your `shield` property that has been set to a value other than `document`. This message will appear when the site is missing your custom shield folder. Open `.\www\test\lot\state\config.php` then make sure that the `shield` value is set to `document`.

### Step 6: Extensions, Plugins and Shields

Everything is OK. You can start installing the previous [shields][link:../reference/shield], [extensions][link:../reference/extension] and [plugins][link:../reference/extension/plugin] that is located in the parent folder. But it is a good practice to install the fresh version of them instead of moving the previous extensions, plugins and shields one by one.

### Step 7: Double Check the 5<sup>th</sup> Step

Double check the 5<sup>th</sup> step to make sure that everything is OK.

You may need to configure back the shields, extensions and plugins to match with the previous configuration value. Most of them are stored in:

 - `.\www\lot\shield\{$shield}\state\config.php`
 - `.\www\lot\extend\{$extend}\lot\state\config.php`
 - `.\www\lot\extend\plugin\lot\worker\{$plugin}\lot\state\config.php`

### Step 8: Delete All Files in the Parent Folder

Delete or move all files in the parent folder (except the `test` folder) to a new folder, just in case:

### Step 9: Restore the File Locations

Move all files that are now placed in the `test` folder to its parent folder:

![8](%{asset}%/png/article/update-view/8.png)

### Step 10: Delete the Temporary Folder

You can now delete the `test` folder!

So that you will get only this:

### Step 11: Upload the Site

You can now pack the updated site then upload it to the web server. There are some things to be concerned:

 - The best way to update the online site is by deleting the entire site and then replacing it with the new one instead of overwriting the site files.
 - Some site data like [comments][link:../reference/extension/comment], [polls][link:../reference/extension/poll], and [views][link:../reference/extension/plugin/view] are mostly generated by your visitors. Remember that! Make sure you don’t make a mistake by deleting them!
