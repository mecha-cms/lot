I have updated the [`Page`][link:../reference/class/page] class recently so that now we can have more meaningful default page data.

### Time

The engine will first search for a hard-coded `time` data from the page file to be used. If it doesn’t exist, then it will use the page’s file creation time as the page time. But, if the page’s file name itself is formatted as a timestamp-like format, then the engine will try to parse the page’s file name into a valid `time` data. So now you can set a file name as `2017-04-21-14-25-02.page` to set the `time` data to `2017-04-21 14:25:02` or `2017-04-21.page` to set the `time` data to `2017-04-21 00:00:00`.

### ID

The default `id` value will use the `time` value that is converted into unsigned _Unix_ time format as string.

### Type

The default `type` value is `text/html`.
