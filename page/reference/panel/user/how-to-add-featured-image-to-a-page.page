title: Add Featured Image to a Page
...

To add featured image to a page, you need to install the [link:/reference/extension/image] extension and [link:/reference/extension/plugin/image] plugin.

 - Navigate to the [page editor][link:how-to-update-a-page] then click the _Image_ tab.
 - Click the _Image_ field to select an image file.
 - Determine the exact image width and height in the _Width_ and _Height_ field to automatically resize and crop the uploaded image. Leave it empty to keep the original image width and height.

The image data will be available in `$page->image` object so you can add this data to the template like so:

~~~ .html
<?php if ($page->image): ?>
<img alt="" src="<?php echo $page->image; ?>">
<?php endif; ?>
~~~

To delete the uploaded image, go to the [page editor][link:how-to-update-a-page] then click the _Image_ tab. Select the _Remove_ field then click the _Update_ button at the bottom of your page editor.
