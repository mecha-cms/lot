### Path

~~~ .txt
<$url>/<$slug>/::<$command>::/<$directory>/<$path>
~~~

 - `$url` → the base URL
 - `$slug` → the `path` value as defined in `lot\extend\panel\lot\state\config.php`
 - `$command` → in general, it can be `s`, `g` or `r` ([info][link:../../article/case-grammar])
 - `$directory` → the base folder name relative to [`LOT`][link:../constant]
 - `$path` → any path that maps to the file/folder in `$directory`

Examples:

~~~ .txt
http://127.0.0.1/panel/::s::/asset/css → create a file in `lot\asset\css`
http://127.0.0.1/panel/::g::/asset/css/a.css → edit `a.css` file that is stored in `lot\asset\css` folder
http://127.0.0.1/panel/::r::/asset/css/a.css → delete `a.css` file that is stored in `lot\asset\css` folder
~~~
