These PHP variables are reserved. You shouldnâ€™t redefine these PHP variables where possible. Consider to [name a variable with custom prefix for private use][link:../article/case-variable-name]. Global variables are stored in the `$GLOBALS` variable. Add your own public variables there to be used in the layout files.
