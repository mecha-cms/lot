Extension is a core feature enhancer that has a higher level than plugin. An extension doesn’t have to change the behavior of your site directly, it can also be used as an API enhancer that does nothing until you use it on a particular [plugin][link:plugin] or [shield][link:shield], or even in a private function file that you have.

An extension is a folder with a unique name, stored in `lot\extend` folder:

~~~ .txt
lot\
 └── extend\
     ├── asset\
     ├── page\
     ├── extension-1\
     ├── extension-2\
     ├── …
     └── …
~~~

A standard extension should at least contains files that structured like this:

~~~ .txt
extension-1\
 ├── engine\
 │   ├── kernel\
 │   │   └── extension-1.php
 │   ├── plug\
 │   │   └── extension-1.php
 │   └── fire.php
 ├── lot\
 │   ├── asset\
 │   │   ├── .htaccess
 │   │   ├── css\
 │   │   └── js\
 │   ├── language\
 │   │   ├── en-us.page
 │   │   └── id-id.page
 │   └── state\
 │       └── config.php
 ├── about.page
 └── index.php
~~~

But the simplest one can be achieved as:

~~~ .txt
extension-1\
 ├── about.page
 └── index.php
~~~

> **Note:** The `.htaccess` file is required to enable access of the asset files publicly. It only contains this command:
>
> ~~~ .htaccess
> allow from all
> ~~~

The most important part is the `index.php` file. The automatic extension loader will seek for `index.php` file and once it found, then the engine will include it before the shield is loaded.
