There is no such class named `Response` in Mecha. Literally, any value that you spit out through `echo` in any `index.php` file will becomes the response. You may need some help from the [link:lot] class to determine response status and MIME type.

~~~ .php
Lot::status(200);
Lot::type('application/json');

echo To::JSON([
    'status' => 200,
    'content' => 'I am a JSON now.'
]);

exit;
~~~
