title: `$asset::path()`
description: Generate full private file path of the `$path`.
...

First of all, this method will find out whether there is a `style.css` file relative to the asset directory [^1] of the current shield folder, if it does not exist, then this method will find out whether there is a `style.css` file relative to the main asset directory [^2]. If none was found, this method will return `$fail`.

~~~ .php.xmp
Asset::path($path, $fail = false);
~~~

**Example:**

~~~ .php
$path = Asset::path('style.css');
~~~

> **Note:** Setting external URL to the `$path` parameter will return to `$fail`.

[^1]: `lot\sheild\{$shield}\asset`
[^2]: `lot\asset`
