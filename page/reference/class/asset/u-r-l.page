title: `$asset::{url,u_r_l}()`
description: Generate full public URL path of the `$path`.
...

First of all, this method will run the `Asset::path()` method to determine whether the file is exists. If it does exist, then the returned file path will be converted into public URL path, otherwise, this method will return `$fail` for relative URL path or `$path` for external URL.

~~~ .php.xmp
Asset::url($path, $fail = false);
~~~

~~~ .php.xmp
Asset::u_r_l($path, $fail = false); // alias
~~~

**Example:**

~~~ .php
$url = Asset::url('style.css');
~~~

> **Note:** Setting external URL to the `$path` parameter will return that `$path` anyway.
