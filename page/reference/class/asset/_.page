description: Define how the asset data should be outputted.

~~~ .php.xmp
Asset::_($kin, $fn);

To make it specific to the [`Asset`][link:] class, make sure to add a dot character just before the method name you want to add. Other than that, the results will inherit to [`Genome::_()`][link:../genome#reference:plug]:

~~~ .php
Asset::_('.css', function($value, $key, $attr) {
    return '<link href="' . $value['url'] . '" rel="stylesheet">';
});
