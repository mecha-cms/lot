title: `$h_t_t_p::cookie()`
description: Return the `$_COOKIE` data.
...

~~~ .php.xmp
HTTP::cookie($key = null, $fail = null, $eval = true);
~~~

Consider to use the [`Cookie::get()`][link:../cookie/get] method instead.

> **Note:** Values include `0`, `'0'`, and `' '` are considered not empty. So, returning a data contains these kind of value will not trigger the `$fail` value.
