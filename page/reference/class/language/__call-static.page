~~~ .php.xmp
Language::{$property}($vars = [], $preserve_case = false);
~~~

~~~ .php
echo Language::home();

Letâ€™s say we have a language property called `test` like this:

~~~ .yaml
test: Hello %{place}%! My name is %{object}%.
~~~

Then:

~~~ .php
echo Language::test([
    'place' => 'world',
    'object' => 'Mocha'
]);
~~~

The code above will return the `test` value into this:

~~~ .txt
Hello world! My name is Mocha.
