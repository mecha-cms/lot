title: `$file->get()`
description: Reading file line by line.
...

An alternative to the [`read()`][link:read] method which allow you to stop the reading process on a specific line/condition.

~~~ .php.xmp
->get($stop = null, $fail = false, $ch = 1024);
~~~

**Example:**

Stop reading at line 4:

~~~ .php
echo File::open('path\to\file.txt')->get(3);
~~~

Stop reading at a line that contains `$`:

~~~ .php
echo File::open('path\to\file.txt')->get('$');
~~~

Stop reading at a line that contains `$` exactly at position `12`:

~~~ .php
echo File::open('path\to\file.txt')->get(['$', 12]);
