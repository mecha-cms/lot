@description: Reading file line by line.
@lot:
  - int $stop = null, $fail = false, $ch = 1024
  - string $stop = null, $fail = false, $ch = 1024
  - array $stop, $fail = false, $ch = 1024
  - callable $stop, $fail = false, $ch = 1024
@example: |
  // Stop reading at line 4
  echo File::open('.\path\to\file.txt')->get(3);
  // Stop reading at line that contains `$`
  echo File::open('.\path\to\file.txt')->get('$');
  // Stop reading at line that contains `$` exactly at position `12`
  echo File::open('.\path\to\file.txt')->get(['$', 12]);
  // Stop reading at `true` condition
  echo File::open('.\path\to\file.txt')->get(function($chunk, $i, $out) {
      $chunk = trim($chunk);
      return $chunk === "" || $chunk === '---';
  });

An alternative to the [`read()`][link:read] method which allow you to stop the reading process on a specific line/condition.
