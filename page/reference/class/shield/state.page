@description: Get shield state data.
@lot: $id, $key = null, $fail = false
@static: 1
@example: |
  // Return the stored shield states if any, otherwise, return `$fail`
  $state = Shield::state('document');
@example-note: |
  If `$key` is array, then it will going to be the alternate values of the `$state` output if some data are not available; `$fail` data value will be ignored:

  ~~~ .php
  $state = Shield::state('document', [
      'chunk' => 5 // add `chunk` property to `$state` if missing
  ]);
  ~~~
