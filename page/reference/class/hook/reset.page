title: `$hook::reset()`
description: Remove a hook.
...

~~~ .php.xmp
Hook::reset($id = null, $stack = null | $fn = null);
~~~

**Example:**

Remove an attached `head.content` hook with ID `fn_meta` before execution, or prevent a `head.content` hook with ID `fn_meta` to be attached:

~~~ .php
Hook::reset('head.content', 'fn_meta');
~~~

> **Note:** You cannot remove hooks that are attached using anonymous function because they have no ID.
