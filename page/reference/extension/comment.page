Edit the `page.php` file in your active shield folder then put this snippet after the `</article>` tag:

~~~ .php
<?php Shield::get('comments'); ?>
~~~

### Constants

This extension automatically adds a `comment` folder within the `lot` folder, which will also automatically set a new constant based on the folder name with a value of the folder path:

~~~ .php
COMMENT
~~~

### Classes

We now have a `Comment` class which works the same as the [`Page`][link:../class/page] class, but with custom hook _namespace_:

~~~ .php.xmp
Comment($input = null, $lot = [], $NS = 'comment');
~~~

Example:

~~~ .php
$comment = new Comment('.\lot\comment\article\test-page\2014-05-05-09-09-32.page');
~~~
