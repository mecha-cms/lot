### Installation

Edit the `page.php` file in your active skin folder then put this snippet after the `</article>` tag:

~~~ .php
<?php static::comments(); ?>
~~~

### Comment Flags

You can set specific comment visibility through page properties. Add a `comment` property within your pageâ€™s `state` property with one of these values:

Value | Description
----- | -----------
`0` | Disable comments.
`1` | Enable comments (default).
`2` | Disable comments, but keep the published comments visible.
`false` | Alias for `0`.
`true` | Alias for `1`.

**Example:**

~~~ .yaml
---
title: Page Title
description: Page description.
author: Taufik Nurrohman
type: Markdown
state:
  comment: false
...

Page content.
~~~

To set pre-defined comment visibility globally, specify a comment flag on the first array of the content arguments:

~~~ .php
<?php static::comments([2]); ?>
~~~

---

### Constant

This extension will add a folder called `comment` in the `.\lot` folder, which will also automatically add a constant named `COMMENT`.

~~~ .php
COMMENT
~~~

### Class

We now have a `Comment` class which works the same as the [`Page`][link:../class/page] class, but with custom hook prefix:

~~~ .php.xmp
Comment(string $path = null, array $lot = [], $prefix = ['*', 'comment']): self;
~~~

**Example:**

~~~ .php
$comment = new Comment('.\lot\comment\article\test-page\2014-05-05-09-09-32.page');
~~~
