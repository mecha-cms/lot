### Usage

#### Basic

All HTML tags will be removed except inline HTML tags listed in the [`HTML_WISE_I`][link:../../constant] constant. Two line break will be treated as a paragraph, single line break will be treated as a hard break. A quote can contain text with a pair of straight double quotation mark for aesthetics or not at all. The first straight double quotation mark will be replaced by `&#x201C;` and the second straight double quotation mark will be replaced by `&#x201D;`. A pair of straight single quotation mark will be replaced by `&#x2018;` and `&#x2019;`, the rest will be replaced by `&#x2019;`.

I forgive people but that doesn't mean I accept their behavior or trust them. I forgive them for me. So, I can let go and move on with my life. Forgiveness doesn't always mean a second chance.
