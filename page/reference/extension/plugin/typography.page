![1](%{asset}%/png/reference/extension/plugin/typography.png)

This plugin will convert some plain ASCII punctuation characters into “smart” punctuation HTML entities:

 - Convert straight quotes (`'` and `"`) into “curly” quote HTML entities
 - Convert dashes (`--` and `---`) into ‘en-dash’ and ‘em-dash’ HTML entities
 - Convert three consecutive dots (`...`) into an ‘ellipsis’ HTML entity.

This plugin will not modify characters within `<pre>`, `<code>`, `<kbd>` or `<script>` tag block because these tags are commonly used to display text where smart quotes and other “smart punctuation” would not be appropriate, such as source code or example markup.
