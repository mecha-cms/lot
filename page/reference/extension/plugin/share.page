...

The share counts are taken based on the number of visits to the social sharing links, and not based on the actual social sharing counter value from each service. This means that if you open the sharing link and then decide to cancel it, the counter value will still be incremented and not returned to the previous value.

### Customization

The default appearance looks like this:

Open `.\lot\plugin\share\lot\state\config.php` then look at the `style` property:

~~~ .php
[
    'counter' => true, // Enable sharing counter?
    'active' => ['facebook', 'twitter'],
    'style' => ['3d', 'color'] // Modify the social sharing button(s) appearance
]
~~~

Modifier for the `style` property:

 - `3d`
 - `color`
 - `icon`
 - `round`

#### Color

Add `color` to the `style` array to colorize the widget.

#### Icon

Add `icon` to the `style` array to replace the text widget with a tooltip.

#### Round

Add `round` to the `style` array to make the button corner becomes rounded.

### Basic Usage

Add this snippet to the `page.php` file, usually just before the `</article>` tag:

~~~ .html
<p><?php static::share(); ?></p>
~~~

### Advance Usage

To show specific sharing services only:

~~~ .html
<p><?php static::share(['facebook', 'twitter']); ?></p>
~~~

> **Note:** The sharing services listed above must be available in the `active` property and must have the property data set in `.\lot\x\plugin\lot\share\lot\state\a.php`.

To override the default configuration data:

~~~ .html
<p><?php static::share([
    'counter' => true,
    'active' => ['facebook', 'twitter'],
    'style' => ['color']
]); ?></p>
~~~
