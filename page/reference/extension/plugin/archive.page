Use this plugin to show all of the visible pages in a single page content as a link list.

### Basic Usage

Put this block in the desired page content you want to display the link list to:

~~~ .txt
[‌[‌archive‌]‌]
~~~

### Advance Usage

#### Sorting

By default, this plugin will display a list of pages sorted ascending by its title. If you add `date` attribute with value `true` or [time pattern][link:../../../reference/class/date/pattern], then each list item will be completed with page publication time, and list order will be made based on the page publication time:

~~~ .txt
[‌[‌archive date="true"‌]‌]

[‌[‌archive date="%Y/%m/%d"‌]‌]
~~~

#### Folder Selection

You can also limit the list output by determining the folder path relative to [link:../../../reference/constant/page]. This is useful for creating archive pages by category:

~~~ .yaml

#### Nesting Level

The maximum recursion value is `5` by default, but you can specify another number. Determining value `1` will deactivate the recursive list feature:

~~~ .txt
