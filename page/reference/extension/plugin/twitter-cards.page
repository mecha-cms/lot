With **Twitter Cards**, you can attach rich photos, videos and media experience to _tweets_ that drive traffic to your website. Users who _tweet_ links to your content will have a “Card” added to the _tweet_ that’s visible to all of their followers.

Open `lot\extend\plugin\lot\worker\twitter-cards\lot\state\config.php` to configure:

~~~ .php
[
    'twitter_site' => "", // website attribution
    'twitter_creator' => "" // twitter user name without the `@` prefix
]
~~~
