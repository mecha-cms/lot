The fastest way to publish a status message.

### Usage

#### Basic

All HTML tags will be removed. Two line break will be treated as a paragraph, single line break will be treated as a hard break. Text link will be converted into a clickable link. Image link will be converted into an image.

It is recommended to format the file name as a time format like `2017-08-28-21-59-26.page`, or as a unique ID that has no meaning at all like `59a42ffbce123.page` or `96fc518719a1eb1924ef4cbd0bc6026a0fcdb332.page`.
