### Usage

Append `?q=search+query` to the pages URL to search pages by file name or file content.

Add this snippet just before the `</header>` in `before.php` file of your active skin folder to add the default search form:

~~~ .php
<?php static::form('search'); ?>
~~~

### Conditions

These page conditional statements are available to quickly determine the type of page we are currently in:

 - `$site->is('search')` → Return `true` if current page is a search results page.

### Classes

These HTML classes will be added to the `<html>` element that has a `class` attribute:

 - `is:search` → Will be added on search results page.
