#### Audio

Convert audio links into native HTML5 audio player.

##### Basic

Set audio URL as the page content.

~~~ .yaml
---
title: Non-Stop Nyan Cat!
type: Audio
...

%{url}%/lot/asset/ogg/nyan.ogg
%{url}%/lot/asset/mp3/nyan.mp3
~~~

##### Link

Set audio link as the page content.

~~~ .yaml
---
title: Non-Stop Nyan Cat!
type: Audio
...

<a href="%{url}%/lot/asset/ogg/nyan.ogg">Nyan OGG</a>
<a href="%{url}%/lot/asset/mp3/nyan.mp3">Nyan MP3</a>
~~~

##### HTML

You can also use raw `<audio>` markup as the page content.

~~~ .yaml
---
title: Non-Stop Nyan Cat!
type: Audio
...

<audio controls>
  <source src="%{url}%/lot/asset/ogg/nyan.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <source src="%{url}%/lot/asset/mp3/nyan.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
~~~

Result:

~~~ .html
<section class="audio p">
  <audio controls>
    <source src="%{url}%/lot/asset/ogg/nyan.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    <source src="%{url}%/lot/asset/mp3/nyan.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  </audio>
</section>
~~~

#### Comic

TODO

#### Gallery

Like the _Image_ type, but it will show as multiple images.

##### Basic

~~~ .yaml
---
title: People
type: Gallery
...

%{url}%/lot/asset/png/people/1.png
%{url}%/lot/asset/png/people/2.png
%{url}%/lot/asset/png/people/3.png
~~~

Result:

~~~ .html
<section class="gallery p">
  <figure class="image image-1">
    <img alt="1" src="%{url}%/lot/asset/png/people/1.png">
  </figure>
  <figure class="image image-2">
    <img alt="2" src="%{url}%/lot/asset/png/people/2.png">
  </figure>
  <figure class="image image-3">
    <img alt="3" src="%{url}%/lot/asset/png/people/3.png">
  </figure>
</section>
~~~

##### HTML

Use an `<img>` tag to store the image URL in its `src` attribute or use an `<a>` tag to store the image URL in its `href` attribute, so that when someday you decided to remove this extension, the result will fall back to the raw HTML markup gracefully.

Link text will becomes the image `alt` value.

~~~ .yaml
---
title: People
type: Gallery
...

<img alt="1" src="%{url}%/lot/asset/png/people/1.png">
<img alt="2" src="%{url}%/lot/asset/png/people/2.png">
<img alt="3" src="%{url}%/lot/asset/png/people/3.png">
~~~

~~~ .yaml
---
title: People
type: Gallery
...

<a href="%{url}%/lot/asset/png/people/1.png">1</a>
<a href="%{url}%/lot/asset/png/people/2.png">2</a>
<a href="%{url}%/lot/asset/png/people/3.png">3</a>
~~~

#### Image

This type will search for the first HTML `<img>` tag in the page content and tries to get the `src` value. If no image was found in the page content, this plugin will search for the first HTML `<a>` tag and tries to get the `href` value, then tries to guess whether it is an image URL or not by checking the file extension. If none was found, this plugin will search for the first URL text in the page content and use it as the image URL.

##### Basic

~~~ .yaml
---
title: Autumn
type: Image
...

%{url}%/lot/asset/png/autumn.png
~~~

Result:

~~~ .html
<figure class="image">
  <img alt="autumn" src="%{url}%/lot/asset/png/autumn.png">
</figure>
~~~

##### Caption

Using `description` data as the image caption.

~~~ .yaml
---
title: Autumn
description: There goes some description about this image.
type: Image
...

%{url}%/lot/asset/png/autumn.png
~~~

Result:

~~~ .html
<figure class="image">
  <img alt="autumn" src="%{url}%/lot/asset/png/autumn.png">
  <figcaption>There goes some description about this image.</figcaption>
</figure>
~~~

##### HTML

Use an `<img>` tag to store the image URL in its `src` attribute or use an `<a>` tag to store the image URL in its `href` attribute, so that when someday you decided to remove this extension, the result will fall back to the raw HTML markup gracefully.

Image `alt` attribute will becomes the caption if there is no `description` data provided. Link text will becomes the image `alt` value and the caption if there is no `description` data provided.

~~~ .yaml
---
title: Autumn
type: Image
...

<img alt="autumn" src="%{url}%/lot/asset/png/autumn.png">
~~~

~~~ .yaml
---
title: Autumn
type: Image
...

<a href="%{url}%/lot/asset/png/autumn.png">autumn</a>
~~~

#### Link

TODO

#### Log

Use this type to quickly publish a status message. All HTML tags will be removed. Two line break will be treated as a paragraph, single line break will be treated as a hard break. Text link will be converted into a clickable link. Image link will be converted into an image.

It is recommended to format the file name as a time format like `2017-08-28-21-59-26.page`, or as a unique ID that has no meaning at all like `59a42ffbce123.page` or `96fc518719a1eb1924ef4cbd0bc6026a0fcdb332.page`.

~~~ .yaml
---
type: Log
...

OMG I'm so gay.
~~~

Result:

~~~ .html
<p>OMG I'm so gay.</p>
~~~

#### Quote

##### Basic

All HTML tags will be removed except inline HTML tags listed in the `HTML_WISE_I` constant. Two line break will be treated as a paragraph, single line break will be treated as a hard break. A quote can contain text with a pair of straight double quotation mark for aesthetics or not at all. The first straight double quotation mark will be replaced by `&#x201C;` and the second straight double quotation mark will be replaced by `&#x201D;`. A pair of straight single quotation mark will be replaced by `&#x2018;` and `&#x2019;`, the rest will be replaced by `&#x2019;`.

~~~ .yaml

type: Quote

I forgive people but that doesn't mean I accept their behavior or trust them. I forgive them for me. So, I can let go and move on with my life. Forgiveness doesn't always mean a second chance.
