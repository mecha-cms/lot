### Supported Page Types

 - Audio
 - Comic
 - Gallery
 - Image
 - Link
 - Log
 - Quote
 - Video

#### Audio

Convert audio links into native HTML5 audio player.

##### Basic

Set audio URL as the page content.

~~~ .yaml
---
title: Non-Stop Nyan Cat!
type: Audio
...

http://127.0.0.1/lot/asset/ogg/nyan.ogg
http://127.0.0.1/lot/asset/mp3/nyan.mp3
~~~

##### Link

Set audio link as the page content.

~~~ .yaml
---
title: Non-Stop Nyan Cat!
type: Audio
...

<a href="http://127.0.0.1/lot/asset/ogg/nyan.ogg">Nyan OGG</a>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1/lot/asset/mp3/nyan.mp3">Nyan MP3</a>
~~~

##### HTML

You can also use raw `<audio>` markup as the page content.

~~~ .yaml
---
title: Non-Stop Nyan Cat!
type: Audio
...

<audio controls>
  <source src="http://127.0.0.1/lot/asset/ogg/nyan.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <source src="http://127.0.0.1/lot/asset/mp3/nyan.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
~~~

#### Comic

Like the _Image_ type, but it has a pagination.

##### Basic

~~~ .yaml
---
title: Garfield & Friends
type: Comic
...

http://127.0.0.1/lot/asset/png/garfield/1.png
http://127.0.0.1/lot/asset/png/garfield/2.png
http://127.0.0.1/lot/asset/png/garfield/3.png
~~~

##### HTML

Use an `<img>` tag to store the image URL in its `src` attribute or use an `<a>` tag to store the image URL in its `href` attribute, so that when someday you decided to remove this extension, the result will fall back to the raw HTML markup gracefully.

Link text will becomes the image `alt` value.

~~~ .yaml
---
title: Garfield & Friends
type: Comic
...

<img alt="1" src="http://127.0.0.1/lot/asset/png/people/1.png">
<img alt="2" src="http://127.0.0.1/lot/asset/png/people/2.png">
<img alt="3" src="http://127.0.0.1/lot/asset/png/people/3.png">
~~~

~~~ .yaml
---
title: Garfield & Friends
type: Comic
...

<a href="http://127.0.0.1/lot/asset/png/people/1.png">1</a>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1/lot/asset/png/people/2.png">2</a>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1/lot/asset/png/people/3.png">3</a>
~~~

#### Gallery

Like the _Comic_ type, but it will show as multiple images.

##### Basic

~~~ .yaml
---
title: People
type: Gallery
...

http://127.0.0.1/lot/asset/png/people/1.png
http://127.0.0.1/lot/asset/png/people/2.png
http://127.0.0.1/lot/asset/png/people/3.png
~~~

##### HTML

Use an `<img>` tag to store the image URL in its `src` attribute or use an `<a>` tag to store the image URL in its `href` attribute, so that when someday you decided to remove this extension, the result will fall back to the raw HTML markup gracefully.

Link text will becomes the image `alt` value.

~~~ .yaml
---
title: People
type: Gallery
...

<img alt="1" src="http://127.0.0.1/lot/asset/png/people/1.png">
<img alt="2" src="http://127.0.0.1/lot/asset/png/people/2.png">
<img alt="3" src="http://127.0.0.1/lot/asset/png/people/3.png">
~~~

~~~ .yaml
---
title: People
type: Gallery
...

<a href="http://127.0.0.1/lot/asset/png/people/1.png">1</a>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1/lot/asset/png/people/2.png">2</a>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1/lot/asset/png/people/3.png">3</a>
~~~

#### Image

This type will search for the first HTML `<img>` tag in the page content and tries to get the `src` value. If no image was found in the page content, this plugin will search for the first HTML `<a>` tag and tries to get the `href` value, then tries to guess whether it is an image URL or not by checking the file extension. If none was found, this plugin will search for the first URL text in the page content and use it as the image URL.

##### Basic

~~~ .yaml
---
title: Autumn
type: Image
...

http://127.0.0.1/lot/asset/png/autumn.png
~~~

Result:

~~~ .html
<figure class="image">
  <img alt="autumn" src="http://127.0.0.1/lot/asset/png/autumn.png">
</figure>
~~~

##### Caption

Using `description` data as the image caption.

~~~ .yaml
---
title: Autumn
description: There goes some description about this image.
type: Image
...

http://127.0.0.1/lot/asset/png/autumn.png
~~~

##### HTML

Use an `<img>` tag to store the image URL in its `src` attribute or use an `<a>` tag to store the image URL in its `href` attribute, so that when someday you decided to remove this extension, the result will fall back to the raw HTML markup gracefully.

Image `alt` attribute will becomes the caption if there is no `description` data provided. Link text will becomes the image `alt` value and the caption if there is no `description` data provided.

~~~ .yaml
---
title: Autumn
type: Image
...

<img alt="autumn" src="http://127.0.0.1/lot/asset/png/autumn.png">
~~~

~~~ .yaml
---
title: Autumn
type: Image
...

<a href="http://127.0.0.1/lot/asset/png/autumn.png">autumn</a>
~~~

#### Link

TODO

#### Log

Use this type to quickly publish a status message. All HTML tags will be removed. Two line break will be treated as a paragraph, single line break will be treated as a hard break. Text link will be converted into a clickable link. Image link will be converted into an image.

It is recommended to format the file name as a time format like `2017-08-28-21-59-26.page`, or as a unique ID that has no meaning at all like `59a42ffbce123.page` or `96fc518719a1eb1924ef4cbd0bc6026a0fcdb332.page`.

~~~ .yaml
---
type: Log
...

OMG I'm so gay.
~~~

#### Quote

##### Basic

All HTML tags will be removed except inline HTML tags listed in the `HTML_WISE_I` constant. Two line break will be treated as a paragraph, single line break will be treated as a hard break. A quote can contain text with a pair of straight double quotation mark for aesthetics or not at all. The first straight double quotation mark will be replaced by `&#x201C;` and the second straight double quotation mark will be replaced by `&#x201D;`. A pair of straight single quotation mark will be replaced by `&#x2018;` and `&#x2019;`, the rest will be replaced by `&#x2019;`.

~~~ .yaml
---
type: Quote
...

I forgive people but that doesn't mean I accept their behavior or trust them. I forgive them for me. So, I can let go and move on with my life. Forgiveness doesn't always mean a second chance.
~~~

##### Citation

Cite the original author by adding a line of text at the top of your quote as the author name, followed by a colon.

~~~ .yaml
---
type: Quote
...

Jason Dawg:

"I forgive people but that doesn't mean I accept their behavior or trust them. I forgive them for me. So, I can let go and move on with my life. Forgiveness doesn't always mean a second chance."
~~~

##### Link

Convert author name into clickable link by adding `link` data to the page header.

~~~ .yaml
---
type: Quote
link: 'http://example.com'
...

Jason Dawg:

"I forgive people but that doesn't mean I accept their behavior or trust them. I forgive them for me. So, I can let go and move on with my life. Forgiveness doesn't always mean a second chance."
~~~

##### HTML

If there are some paragraph or block quote tags contained in the page content, no conversion will be attempted (a typical content generated by a WYSIWYG editor).

*[WYSIWYG]: What You See Is What You Get

~~~ .yaml
---
type: Quote
...

<blockquote class="test">
  <p>"I forgive people but that doesn't mean I accept their behavior or trust them. I forgive them for me. So, I can let go and move on with my life. Forgiveness doesn't always mean a second chance."</p>
</blockquote>
