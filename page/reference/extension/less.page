This extension compiles Less code into CSS code by looking for files with extension `less` that are added through the `Asset::set()` method, storing the compiled results as a static file and then displaying it as a CSS file. The compiled file content will be updated automatically on every file modification changes on the Less file.

~~~ .txt
.\path\to\file.less → .\path\to\file.css
.\path\to\less\file.less → .\path\to\css\file.css
~~~

### Usage

Dynamic loading:

~~~ .php
Asset::set('.\path\to\file.less');
~~~

Direct loading:

~~~ .php
echo Asset::less('.\path\to\file.less');
