An extension doesn’t have to change the behavior of your site directly. It can also be used as an API enhancer that does nothing until you use it on a particular [skin][link:extension/content], or in your personal function file.

An extension is a folder with a unique name, stored in `.\lot\x` folder:

~~~ .txt
.\
└── lot\
    └── x\
        ├── asset\
        ├── extension-1\
        ├── extension-2\
        ├── page\
        ├── …
        └── …
~~~

A standard extension should at least contains files that structured like this:

~~~ .txt
.\lot\x\extension-1\
├── engine\
│   ├── kernel\
│   │   └── extension-1.php
│   ├── plug\
│   │   └── extension-1.php
│   └── fire.php
├── lot\
│   ├── asset\
│   │   ├── .htaccess
│   │   ├── css\
│   │   └── js\
│   └── state\
│       └── config.php
├── about.page
└── index.php
~~~

But the simplest one can be achieved as:

~~~ .txt
.\lot\x\extension-1\
├── about.page
└── index.php
~~~

> **Note:** The `.htaccess` file is required to enable access of the asset files publicly. It only contains the following command:
>
> ~~~ .htaccess
> allow from all
> ~~~

The most important part is the `index.php` file. The automatic extension loader will seek for `index.php` file and once it found, then the engine will include it before everything else is being loaded.
